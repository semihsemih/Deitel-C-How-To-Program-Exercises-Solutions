### Target-Heart-Rate Calculator

While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years. Your target heart rate is a range that’s 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified health care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.] Create a program that reads the user’s birthday and the current day (each consisting of the month, day and year). Your program should calculate and display the person’s age (in years), the person’s maximum heart rate and the person’s target-heart-rate range.
