### Body Mass Index Calculator

Create a BMI calculator application that reads the user’s weight in 
kilograms and height in meters, then calculates and displays the user’s 
body mass index. Also, the application should display the following information 
from the Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health so 
the user can evaluate his/her BMI:

BMI VALUES   
Underweight: less than 18.5   
Normal:      between 18.5 and 24.9   
Overweight:  between 25 and 29.9   
Obese:       30 or greater
