 ### Palindrome Tester
 A palindrome is a number or a text phrase that reads the same backward as forward. For example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554 and 11611. Write a program that reads in a five-digit integer and determines whether or not itâ€™s a palindrome. 
 
 **Hint**: Use the division and remainder operators to separate the number into its individual digits.
