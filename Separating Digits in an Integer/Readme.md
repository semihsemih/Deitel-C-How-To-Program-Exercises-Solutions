### Separating Digits in an Integer

Write a program that inputs one five-digit number, separates the number into its 
individual digits and prints the digits separated from one another by three spaces each. 

[Hint: Use combinations of integer division and the remainder operation.] 

For example, if the user types in 42139, the program should print =>  4   2   1   3   9
