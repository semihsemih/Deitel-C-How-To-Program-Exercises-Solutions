### Factorial - Calculate Value of the Mathematical Constant e

**a)** Write a program that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial. 
**b)** Write a program that estimates the value of the mathematical constant e by using the formula:

>e = 1 + (1 / 1!) + (1 / 2!) + (1 / 3!) + ....
