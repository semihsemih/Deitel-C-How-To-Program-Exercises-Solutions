### Find the Largest Number

 The process of finding the largest number (i.e., the maximum of a group of numbers) is used frequently in computer applications. For example, a program that determines the winner of a sales contest would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest. Write a pseudocode program and then a program that inputs a series of 10 non-negative numbers and determines and prints the largest of the numbers. 
 
 Hint: Your program should use three variables as follows:   
 
 **counter**: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed) 
 **number**: The current number input to the program 
 **largest**: The largest number found so far
