Hey there. I am recording the solutions of the selected exercises of the 7th printing of “C How To Program” book in this repository. I strongly reccomend the reading of the question section of the exercises that you’re interested in. I intend to update the solutions in a reasonable pace, starting now.

I hope this might help anyone who has an interest in the book and C language as a whole. If you have any question, want to debate about the book, or think that some solution may be wrong or could be improved, feel free to send me an e-mail at: semih_.arslan@icloud.com
