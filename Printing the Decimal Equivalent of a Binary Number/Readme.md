### Printing the Decimal Equivalent of a Binary Number

Input an integer (5 digits or fewer) containing only 0s and 1s (i.e., a “binary” integer) and print its decimal equivalent. 

**Hint**: Use the remainder and division operators to pick off the “binary” number’s digits one at a time from right to left. Just as in the decimal number system, in which the rightmost digit has a positional value of 1, and the next digit left has a positional value of 10, then 100, then 1000, and so on, in the binary number system the rightmost digit has a positional value of 1, the next digit left has a positional value of 2, then 4, then 8, and so on. Thus the decimal number 234 can be interpreted as 4 * 1 + 3 * 10 +  2 * 100. The decimal equivalent of binary 1101 is 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 8 or 1 + 0 + 4 + 8 or 13.
