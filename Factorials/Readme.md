### Factorials

The factorial function is used frequently in probability problems. The factorial of a positive integer n (written n! and pronounced “n factorial”) is equal to the product of the positive integers from 1 to n. Write a program that evaluates the factorials of the integers from 1 to 5. Print the results in tabular format.
